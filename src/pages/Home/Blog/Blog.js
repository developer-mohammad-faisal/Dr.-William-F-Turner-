              your mobile apps, web apps, etc. It is a service provided by

              Firebase Authentication provides backend services, an easy-to-use
              SDK, and a UI library built into your app to authenticate users.
              Most website users need to know their identity by supporting
              authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated
              identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter and many
              more. An anonymous app allows an app to securely store user data
              in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across
              all user devices.
